 * - The segment from the middle of (0,0) to the right edge of (0,0), with a distance of 0.5 cells
 * - The segment from the left edge of (0,1) to the right edge of (0,1), with a distance of 1 cell
 * - The segment from the left edge of (0,2) to the middle of (0,2), with a distance of 0.5 cells
 * Each segment also contains the entry and exit points for that cell, as a fraction of the cell's width/height.
 * For example, for the first segment above, the entry would be { x: 0.5, y: 0.5 } since it started in the middle
 * of the cell. The exit would be { x: 1.0, y: 0.5 } since it exited on the right side of the cell.
